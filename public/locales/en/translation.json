        "text_history": "At the end of World War II, the UK and EU military government argued that exports would offer a way out of economic devastation. Despite the terrible conditions that existed then, the country had to move resources and begin to export quality products. Once on its feet, the country could pay the reparations produced by the war.<br /><br /> As a result of this initiative, it was decided to organize the first Export Fair. The initially proposed location for this fair was Düsseldorf, a town that rejected the idea. Subsequently, the city of Hannover was proposed, which had been an important industrial and arms production center in past decades. During World War II the city was the target of numerous bombardments due to this fact.",

Between August 18 and September 7, 1947, export orders were issued for an amount of 31.6 million dollars. With the passage of time, the sectors that made up the Export Fair Originally they specialized and became independent fairs, such as LIGNA, IAA and the Hannover Messe. These, in turn, became the platforms for fairs around the world. Deutsche Messe AG has a presence in 100 countries, 113 fairs in 48 different parts of the world and 10 subsidiaries globally. With an area of ​​nearly 1 million square meters, 500 thousand of which are covered, we have the largest fairground in the world in Germany.
