Despite the terrible conditions that existed then, the country had to move resources and begin to export quality products. Once on its feet, the country could pay the reparations produced by the war.<br /><br /> As a result of this initiative, it was decided to organize the first Export Fair. The initially proposed location for this fair was Düsseldorf, a town that rejected the idea.
